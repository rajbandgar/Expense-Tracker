## 💡 Inspiration

As a Full Stack Developer in training, I built this Expense Tracker to strengthen my understanding of the MERN stack, RESTful APIs, and authentication flows. Managing personal finances is a real-world problem, so I wanted to solve it with a clean, functional web app that also demonstrates my full-stack capabilities.  

This project also helped me explore frontend state management, secure backend APIs, and real-world deployment practices—all skills I'm excited to apply in professional settings.
